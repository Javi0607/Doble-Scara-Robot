# Doble-Scara-Robot
The Dual-arm SCARA Robot project involved designing and constructing a robotic system with two SCARA arms. The project included developing both forward and inverse kinematics for precise control, creating a MATLAB-based communication interface for real-time command and data visualization, and implementing a user-friendly graphical interface for seamless robot operation and monitoring.
